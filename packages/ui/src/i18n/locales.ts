 * Deliberately a short list: every locale here is a permanent commitment,
 * because each new string in the product needs a translation in all of
 * them, forever, and a half-translated interface reads worse than an
 * English one.
 *
 * `name` is the language's name *in that language*. A picker that lists
 * "Chinese (Simplified)" in English is no use to the one person who needs
 * the control, so these are never translated.
 *
 * All eight are left-to-right. Adding Arabic or Hebrew later is a layout
 * change — `dir="rtl"`, logical CSS properties, mirrored icons — and not
 * merely a translation. Worth knowing before anyone promises one.
 *
 * Not to be confused with `public/_locales`, which is a different job in
 * a different format: 35 locales of store-listing name and blurb, read by
 * the browser for the install page. Nothing there reaches this interface.
