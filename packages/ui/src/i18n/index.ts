/**
 * Translation, with no runtime dependency.
 *
 * ## Why the English text is the key
 *
 * `t("Download all")` rather than `t("manager.downloadAll")`. That is gettext's
 * convention and Apple's, and it earns its place three times:
 *
 * - **A missing translation degrades to English**, not to
 *   `manager.downloadAll` on a button. With eight catalogues there is always a gap somewhere,
 *   and the failure has to be survivable.
 * - **The replacement is mechanical.** Wrapping a literal cannot change
 *   what the interface says — which is what lets `localizeDom` below
 *   translate four pages of markup without editing any of it.
 * - **The catalogue reads as prose**, so whoever revises a translation
 *   sees the sentence rather than an identifier to go and look up.
 *
 * The cost is that editing English copy orphans its translations. That is
 * the right trade: a changed sentence *should* be re-translated, and
 * `missing()` makes the gap loud in the test instead of silent on screen.
 *
 * ## Why no library
 *
 * i18next and its peers bring a store layer, an ICU parser and async
 * loading. This ships as both a browser extension and a web page: the
 * popup is opened and torn down constantly, and it must paint
 * immediately. Eight catalogues of short strings are a few KB gzipped, so
 * they are imported statically — no loading state, and no flash of
 * untranslated text on the popup's very first frame.
 *
 * ## Why not chrome.i18n
 *
 * The browser's own mechanism cannot do either half of what is wanted
 * here. Its keys must match `[A-Za-z0-9_]`, so an English sentence cannot
 * be one — the fallback above would be impossible. And it resolves
 * against the *browser's* UI language with no override, so a language
 * picker cannot exist. The store listing may still use it, where both
 * constraints are fine.
